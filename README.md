# xword-dl

Given an online crossword solver's URL, `xword-dl` should download the data and prepare a `.puz` file.

Currently, `xword-dl` works with puzzles using the AmuseLabs "PuzzleMe" platform. That includes:
* Newsday
* New Yorker
* New York Mag
* Washington Post
* The Atlantic

and maybe untested others. It currently needs to be given the solver's specific iframe URL.
